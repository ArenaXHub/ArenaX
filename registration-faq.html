  <div class="faq-card">
    <h3>How many matches will I play?</h3>
    <p>
      Every participant plays multiple matches. The format ensures
      adequate performance assessment and not single-match elimination.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-card">
    <h3>Is this knockout or league format?</h3>
    <p>
      This is not a simple knockout. ArenaX uses a structured assessment
      format combining match play and skill evaluation.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="faq-card">
  <h3>Is Mixed Doubles available?</h3>
  <p>
    Based on registrations and suitability, ArenaX may introduce additional
    pairing formats.
  </p>
</div>


  <div class="faq-card">
    <h3>How long does the event take?</h3>
    <p>
      The event is typically conducted within one day. Reporting time
      and schedules are shared in advance.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-card">
    <h3>Is this for beginners?</h3>
    <p>
      ArenaX is designed for developing and competitive players.
      The focus is skill recognition, not just winning.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-card">
    <h3>Will everyone get a certificate?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. Every participant receives a performance-based certificate,
      not a participation certificate.
